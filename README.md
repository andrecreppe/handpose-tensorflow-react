Real Time Sign Language Detection App with ReactJS and TensorflowJS.

![Execution example](https://github.com/andrecreppe/handpose-tensorflow-react/blob/main/images/example.png?raw=true)

## üì¶ Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). In order to run it, is necessary to install all of the used dependencies/packages using npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```

No ordinary installation is also required.

## üìê Developing

In order to run the application in development mode, start the application using:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Once compiled, it should open a new tab at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the default browser. This page will reload if you edit the code and also warn about any lint errors in the console.

### Custom gestures

For adding other custom gestures, check the [Fingerpose](https://openbase.com/js/fingerpose/documentation) official website and also it's [GitHub page](https://github.com/andypotato/fingerpose/tree/master/src/gestures) for more information in this topic.

## üöÄ Building

Once the application is ready, you can make a build to distribuite it using this command:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

It Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
